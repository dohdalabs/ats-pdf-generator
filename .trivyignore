# Trivy ignore file
# Add patterns to ignore specific vulnerabilities or files
#
# SCAN STRATEGY:
# This file is used by the 'just security' command in CI and local development.
# We use a single scan approach that includes test dependencies for comprehensive
# security coverage while excluding only test artifacts and build outputs.
#
# Use .trivyignore.yaml for targeted vulnerability ignores if needed

# Ignore local development artifacts (minimal, explicit paths)
# Note: Removed broad virtual environment ignores to allow dependency scanning
# Local editor/build cache directories only

# Note: Test source files (tests/, test_*.py, *_test.py) are now INCLUDED
# to allow scanning of test dependencies (pytest, pytest-cov, etc.)
# This ensures comprehensive security coverage of all project dependencies
