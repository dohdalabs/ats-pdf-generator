# Markdown Standards

## Quality Requirements

**ALL markdown files MUST pass markdownlint before being committed.**

### Required Checks

- Run `./scripts/quality/check-markdown.sh --fix <file>` as the first step before committing to automatically resolve violations
- If issues remain, manually fix all markdownlint violations
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy
- Use consistent formatting

### Formatting Standards

- **MD022**: Blank lines around headings - Use blank lines around all headings
- **MD032**: Blank lines around lists - Use blank lines around all lists
- **MD031**: Blank lines around fenced code blocks - Use blank lines around all fenced code blocks
- **MD013**: Line length limits (disabled in project)
- **MD033**: HTML tags (disabled in project)
- **MD041**: First line heading (disabled in project)
- Use consistent heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3 → H4)
- Use kebab-case for file names
- Include table of contents for long documents

### AI Assistant Guidelines

- Always run markdownlint after editing markdown files
- Fix all violations before completing changes
- Use consistent formatting patterns
- Include proper heading structure
- Add blank lines for readability

### Validation Commands

**Check-only (validation):**

```bash
./scripts/quality/check-markdown.sh <filename>
```

**Auto-fix (repair violations):**

```bash
./scripts/quality/check-markdown.sh --fix <filename>
```

**Note**: This file itself must pass markdownlint validation.
