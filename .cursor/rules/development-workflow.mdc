# AI Assistant Development Workflow Rules

## Quick Reference

**Always use `just` commands - never call tools directly:**

- `just validate` - Run fast quality checks (~30s)
- `just test` - Run tests
- `just format` - Auto-fix formatting
- `just ci` - Complete CI pipeline

## Workflow

### 1. Branch-Based Development

```bash
git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
# Never work directly on main
```

### 2. Quality Checks

```bash
just validate  # Run fast quality checks before changes
just test      # Run tests after changes
```

### 3. Commit Standards

```bash
git commit -m "feat: descriptive change"
# Use conventional commits: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
```

### 4. Pull Request Process

1. **Create the Pull Request**

   - Open your PR _after_ completing all checks locally.
   - Use a descriptive title and a detailed body summarizing all meaningful changes:

     ```bash
     gh pr create --title "feat: clear, specific title" --body "## What & Why\n- Summarize each change\n- Explain reasoning & impact\n"
     ```

2. **Validate Build & Checks**

   - Wait for all CI checks and builds to pass on the PR.
   - Do **not** merge unless every required check is green.
   - If a check fails, investigate, push a fix, and wait for successful rerun.

3. **Address Feedback**

   - Review feedback from reviewers.
   - Push follow-up commits addressing review comments.
   - Repeat until approvals are granted and all checks pass.

4. **Final Review Before Merge**

   - Confirm all required checks have passed _after_ latest changes.
   - Carefully review the PR description:
     - Ensure it thoroughly documents **every significant change**.
     - Write with future debugging/investigation in mind; think about what later AI or people will need to understand the context.
     - If relevant, copy release notes or changelog-style bullet points into the description.

5. **Merge via Merge Queue (Squash Only)**

   - Only squash merges via merge queue are allowed; direct pushes to main are forbidden.
   - The PR **title and description** will form the final commit message.
   - Use:

     ```bash
     gh pr merge --squash
     ```

   - **Merge Queue Benefits:**
     - Automatically runs full CI pipeline on merged state
     - Only merges if ALL checks pass
     - Automatically kicks out failed PRs
     - Ensures main branch always has passing code

   - **Merge Queue Process:**
     - PR is added to queue when ready
     - Queue runs complete CI pipeline
     - If CI fails → PR is automatically removed from queue
     - If CI passes → PR is automatically merged
     - No manual intervention needed for quality gates

   - Double-check that the squash commit includes a comprehensive and clear message (title + description).

**Summary:**
A clear and complete PR description is mandatory. This description directly becomes the commit message and will be critical for future teams and AI tools seeking to understand the intent, scope, and reasoning behind changes.

## Code Quality Standards

**Required checks:**

- Python: `just lint-python` (ruff + black + mypy)
- Shell: `just lint-shell` (shellcheck)
- Docker: `just lint-docker` (hadolint)
- Markdown: `just lint-markdown` (markdownlint)

**All must pass before suggesting changes.**

## Commit Message Best Practices

**For comprehensive PRs, use detailed commit messages:**

```text
feat(docker): add comprehensive cloud storage compatibility

## Key Improvements
### Cloud Storage Compatibility
- Enhanced path detection for cloud storage directories
- Improved handling of temporary directories in cloud storage environments

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Streamlined Docker run commands for consistent behavior across platforms
- Improved user flag handling for different operating systems

## Impact
These changes significantly improve the reliability and usability of Docker-based
PDF conversion, especially for users working with cloud storage solutions.
```

## GitHub Squash Merge Settings

**Recommended settings:**

1. Enable squash merging
2. Set default commit message to "Pull request title and description"
3. Avoid "Pull request title and commit details" (includes experimental commits)

**Why "Pull request title and description" is best:**

- ✅ Clean history - No experimental commit noise
- ✅ Comprehensive context - Full PR description preserved
- ✅ AI-friendly - Structured format with clear sections

## Changelog Updates

**Update CHANGELOG.md for user-facing changes:**

- New features → Add to "Added"
- Bug fixes → Add to "Fixed"
- Breaking changes → Add to "Changed" or "Removed"

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Support for custom CSS templates in PDF generation

### Fixed
- Resolve issue where bullet points weren't converted properly (#123)
```

## AI Assistant Guidelines

### When Making Changes

1. **Always work in feature branch**
2. **Run `just validate` before suggesting changes**
3. **Use `just` commands instead of direct tool calls**
4. **Follow established patterns:**

   - Use conventional commits
   - Update documentation for new features
   - Update CHANGELOG.md for user-facing changes
   - Add tests for new functionality

### When Reviewing PR Before Merge

**Critical: The PR title and description become the squash commit message and serve as context for future debugging.**

#### Step 1: Review Current PR State

```bash
# Get current PR number from branch
gh pr view --json number,title,body

# Review linked issues
gh issue view <issue-number> --json title,body,state
```

#### Step 2: Verify PR Accuracy

**Check that PR title:**

- Uses conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Accurately describes the PRIMARY feature/change implemented
- Is concise but specific enough to understand the change

**Check that PR description:**

- Documents EVERY significant change made in the branch
- Not just the original planned scope, but all work actually completed
- Includes implementation details, architecture decisions, testing info
- Contains "Closes #X" or "Fixes #X" to auto-close related issues
- Is written for future investigation/debugging (think: "What will an AI or developer need to know in 6 months?")

#### Step 3: Update PR If Needed

```bash
# Update title
gh pr edit <pr-number> --title "feat: accurate description of work"

# Update description (use heredoc for multi-line)
gh pr edit <pr-number> --body-file /dev/stdin <<'EOF'
## Overview
[Clear summary of what was implemented]

Closes #X

## Key Features
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

## Implementation
[Architecture/technical details]

## Testing
- Test coverage stats
- Verification steps

## Impact
[User/developer impact]
EOF
```

#### Step 4: Verify Issue Linkage

**Ensure issues will auto-close:**

- Include "Closes #X" or "Fixes #X" in PR description
- GitHub will automatically close linked issues when PR merges
- Do NOT manually close issues before merge

#### Step 5: Pre-Merge Checklist

Before adding to merge queue:

- [ ] All CI checks passing on latest commit
- [ ] PR title uses conventional commit format
- [ ] PR title accurately reflects main feature/change
- [ ] PR description comprehensively documents ALL work done
- [ ] PR description includes "Closes #X" for related issues
- [ ] PR description written for future debugging context
- [ ] Code follows project quality standards
- [ ] Tests added for new functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated for user-facing changes

**Only after all checks pass, add PR to merge queue:**

```bash
# Add PR to merge queue
gh pr merge --squash --auto

# Or via GitHub UI: Click "Merge when ready" button
```

**Merge queue will:**

- Automatically run full CI pipeline on merged state
- Only merge if ALL checks pass
- Automatically remove PR from queue if CI fails
- Ensure main branch always has passing code

### When Debugging

```bash
just validate       # Run fast quality checks
just test           # Run tests
just lint-python    # Python linting only
just lint-shell     # Shell script linting
just lint-docker  # Dockerfile linting
just lint-markdown  # Markdown linting
```

### Quality Standards

- All Python code must pass ruff, black, mypy
- All shell scripts must pass shellcheck
- All Dockerfiles must pass hadolint
- All markdown must pass markdownlint
- New features require tests
- Use conventional commit messages
- Update relevant docs for all changes
