# Trivy ignore configuration for targeted vulnerability suppression
# This file allows ignoring specific CVEs or package:version combinations
# while still scanning all dependencies for security vulnerabilities

# Example format for ignoring specific vulnerabilities:
# vulnerabilities:
#   - id: CVE-2023-12345
#   - id: CVE-2023-67890
#     paths:
#       - "path/to/specific/file"
#     expired_at: "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"

# Example format for ignoring misconfigurations:
# misconfigurations:
#   - id: "AVD-K8S-0001"
#     paths:
#       - "k8s/deployment.yaml"

# Currently no known false positives to ignore
# Add entries here as needed when legitimate false positives are identified
# Format: each section should contain objects with required 'id' field and optional fields like 'paths', 'purls', 'expired_at'
